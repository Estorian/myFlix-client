# myFlix-client
This is a frontend client for myFlixDB built using React and React-Bootstrap.
It was built as a showcase of my knowledge of React, and interacts with 
the node.js project in my movie-api repo.

The project is designed to allow users to register an account, login, and then
be displayed a set of movies. They can add movies to their list of favorites
and remove them. They can also edit their profile.

When clicking on the movies, they are show more details about each movie. They
can further click on either the movie's genre or director to be shown details
about them. At the top is located a menu bar with buttons to logout, search,
and edit the user's profile.

Once downloaded, use 
<npm install> 
in the repo folder to install the needed dependencies and libraries.
  
Then, to build the project use CLI command: 
<parcel src/index.html>
to build the project.
